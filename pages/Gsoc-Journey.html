          <p>
            25th March 2023
          </p>
          <p>
            I have started writing this blog today as I know that if I dont get selected for Gsoc 2023,
             I will probably never write it, and whenever I read a blog about Gsoc, it is mostly from a
              participant, and no one who tried very hard and didnt get selected tell about their mistakes.
               So, I will start with my journey
          </p>
          <h3>Gsoc 2022:</h3>
          <p>
             I knew about Gsoc well before it, and I always wanted to participate in it, but I was
             not that serious during that time as our university just called in december 2021 and literally
              did nothing except enjoying my college life as it was due for so long. I always wanted to try 
              for Gsoc from inside but I never know how that time passed! I found out an organisation AnkiAndroid 
              at that time as I have already done a bit of android, but trust me I never applied my knowledge of 
              Android for solving any issue which I solved over there. So year passed by and now again that time comes.
          </p>
          <h3>Gsoc 2023:</h3>
          <p>
             Again I am not so sure, around January end or probably february when the gsoc organisations
             are not yet announced, i made up my mind that i am going to participate this time and started exploring
              which organisations I can apply to. I made my first priority as AnkiAndroid as I was comfortable with it
               by that time but to my surprise I come to know that they are not going to apply for Gsoc this year. Now
                I was in a real problem, I have still not decided any organisation and I have to first start find out a
                 organisation and then contribute to them a bit. This time was a bit of down for me as I was having 
                 nothing in my hand but I was strong for atleast try out this time and I believe this time was one of a 
                 great learning lesson for me too, I find out a lot of organisations that I find a bit interesting, 
                 probably 7-8, joined their talking groups. I cant recognise all those but I can tell in which I put some
                 of my efforts:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <li> 
              <b>CHAOSS:</b> I solved one issue over here but they probably didnâ€™t participate this year too.
            </li>
            <li> 
              <b>DRUPAL:</b> I never got comfortable with their interface and never read or even cloned their 
              code and just solved a typo! But it was out of my list soon.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Oppia:</b> Never able to setup software on my machine
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Chromium:</b> This was the first organisation for which I started preparing my proposal for. 
              I had thoroughly gone with the issue and probably I would have made proposal for it and 
              still while writing this blog, I am thinking that should I make it as my second proposal. 
              The reason I left making its proposal was that I was not able to run chromium on my mac 
              and even my mentor was not bothering replying my with my issue. I really put out my effort 
              for it and did everything. I literally have not done anything, except setting up chromium 
              for around 3 days and then got exhausted and just left it and went around with Owasp. While 
              writing this I am thinking why not start with it again. I must not take much time,2-3 days 
              might be enough
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>OWASP:</b> Now, I was always interested in cybersecurity and so this organisation was on of my
               topmost interest. I tried out solving one bug in ZAP but to my surprise, I was never able 
               to setup it on my mac! I get a lot of problems setting up software on my machine. I have 
               made my proposal and definitely there I have shown in my proposal that i can do the work as 
               i have already started with the work and even presented my work in my proposal.
            </li>
          </dl>
          <p>
            So, In the end I applied for just Owasp for the project Tech Stack Updation for ebook. 
            I will be writting a full Blog for my Project in Future
          </p>

          <p>
            UPDATE (5 May 2023): I have been selected for GSOC 2023!
